      "description": "Meitra (明専トランプ, Meisen Trump) is a sophisticated 4-player partnership trick-taking card game originating from Japan. If you're familiar with Bridge, you'll recognize many similarities—but Meitra introduces unique mechanics like the Jack system, Broken hands, and Chombo violations that create a distinct strategic experience.",
      "keyFeatures": "Key Features",
      "feature1": "Partnership Play: 4 players in 2 teams, partners sit opposite",
      "feature2": "Strategic Bidding: 'Blow' phase similar to Bridge's auction",
      "feature3": "Unique Mechanics: Special Jack hierarchy, JOKER power, and Tra trump",
      "feature4": "Risk & Reward: Declare your tricks wisely—success brings points, failure brings penalties",
      "feature5": "Violation System: 'Chombo' penalties add strategic depth",
      "howToPlay": "How to Play",
      "setup": "Setup",
      "setupDesc": "Meitra uses a modified 53-card deck: cards 5 through Ace in all four suits (♠♥♦♣), plus one JOKER. Cards 2, 3, and 4 are excluded from play but used separately as score markers.",
      "gameFlow": "Game Flow Overview",
      "phase1Title": "1. Deal Phase",
      "phase1Desc": "Each player receives 10 cards. One card remains face-down as the 'hidden card.'",
      "phase2Title": "2. Blow Phase (Bidding)",
      "phase2Desc": "Players take turns declaring how many 'pairs' (tricks) they can win out of 10, and which suit will be trump. Like Bridge's auction, higher bids override lower ones. Minimum bid: 6 pairs.",
      "phase3Title": "3. Play Phase (Trick-taking)",
      "phase3Desc": "The highest bidder (dealer) leads. Players compete to win tricks following standard trick-taking rules with trump and base suit bonuses. Play continues for 10 tricks.",
      "phase4Title": "4. Scoring",
      "phase4Desc": "Points are calculated based on whether the declaring team achieved their bid. First team to 10 points wins!",
      "uniqueMechanics": "What Makes Meitra Special",
      "mechanic1Title": "The Blow System",
      "mechanic1Desc": "Unlike Bridge's complex suit ranking, Meitra uses five trump types with clear hierarchy: Tra (special no-trump) > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs > Spades. Players bid both the number of tricks AND the trump suit, creating layered strategic decisions.",
      "mechanic2Title": "Jack Hierarchy",
      "mechanic2Desc": "When a trump suit is declared (except Tra), two Jacks become super-powered: the 'Main J' (Jack of trump suit) and 'Sub J' (Jack of same color as trump). These become the 2nd and 3rd strongest cards after JOKER, adding tactical depth to hand evaluation.",
      "mechanic3Title": "Broken Hands",
      "mechanic3Desc": "Weak hands (no face cards, or only one Queen) enter a 'Broken' state with special rules. If you hold all four Jacks, you MUST declare Broken—this is called 'Required Broken' and failing to do so is a violation.",
      "mechanic4Title": "Negri Selection",
      "mechanic4Desc": "Before play begins, each player secretly selects their 'Negri' (weakest/unwanted card). This seemingly simple decision has strategic implications and forgetting to select is a Chombo violation!",
      "mechanic5Title": "Chombo (Violations)",
      "mechanic5Desc": "Meitra includes a violation system where opponents can call out rule-breaking: Negri Forget, Four-Jack violations, Last Tanzen (ending with JOKER), and wrong Broken declarations. Only the opposing team can report violations, adding a competitive edge.",
      "bridgeComparison": "For Bridge Players",
      "bridgeComparisonDesc": "Think of Meitra as Bridge's Japanese cousin with a twist. The Blow phase is your auction, pairs are tricks, and the dealer is the declarer. However, Meitra adds unique flavor with its Jack system, simplified trump hierarchy, special violation rules, and the mysterious Tra trump that changes the game dynamics entirely.",
      "scoringSystem": "Scoring Explained",
      "scoringFormula": "Formula: If you meet or exceed your bid (Y ≥ X): 0.5×(Y-X) + X - 5 points | If you fail (Y < X): Y - X points (negative)",
      "scoringExample1": "Example: Bid 7 pairs, win 8 → 0.5×(8-7) + 7 - 5 = 2.5 points ✓",
      "scoringExample2": "Example: Bid 8 pairs, win 6 → 6 - 8 = -2 points ✗",
      "scoringNote": "Notice: Exceeding your bid gives modest bonuses (0.5× multiplier), but failing gives harsh penalties (full difference). This encourages realistic bidding!",
      "culturalNote": "Cultural Context",
      "culturalNoteDesc": "Meitra originated in Japanese student circles, where creative trump-based games developed unique local rules. The name '明専トランプ' (Meisen Trump) references its origins. Terms like 'Blow' (declaration), 'Negri' (unwanted), and 'Chombo' (violation) are Japanese gaming terminology that add character to the game.",
      "readyToPlay": "Ready to Play?",
      "readyToPlayDesc": "Now that you understand the basics, dive into the detailed rules to master the Jack system, learn optimal bidding strategies, and discover the nuances that make Meitra a deeply strategic partnership game. Good luck, and may your Blows be bold!"
